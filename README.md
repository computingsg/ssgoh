# Mr Goh Soon Seng

Mr Goh is a retired software developer who is passionate about imparting his knowledge to youths and adults alike. Driven by the observation of the lack of maker and tinkering coding literacy in school children and the general population, he reached out to Singapore's National Library Board (NLB) to intiaite an outreach programme in NLB's MakeIt makerspace facilities to the general public. The programme is a free five-week [introductory Python programming with Raspberry Pi course](https://learning.nlb.gov.sg/communities/join/digital-communities), with ad-hoc sessions held afterwards, targeting public library users aged 9 and above, conducted weekly in English at MakeIT @ Tampines Regional Library. With 3 regular volunteers, and sometimes her daughter supporting some sessions, he has conducted 7 runs of the programme to date (as at Feb 2023) from Sep 2021.

Besides the Pi with Python introductory course, Mr Goh also started a [Pi Makers Club](https://github.com/ssgoh/The-Pi-Club) with NLB that meets on the first Sunday of each month in 2022, where members undertake more advanced projects using the Raspberry Pi. Starting 2023 they are exploring using the Raspberry Pi Pico, a microcontroller that runs MicroPython. 

All programme information and learning resources are [shared with the community and open sourced](https://github.com/ssgoh).

Mr Goh has also shared about his motivation and experience at [PyCon SG 2019](https://pycon.sg/edu-summit) (lightning talk: Making Python our Digital Mother Tongue) and [PyCon SG 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkvsHHpfFIc&t=9508s) (talk: Pi and Python).
